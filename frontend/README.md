# Don't Be Stupid

This game is designed primarily for "Party TV space" or larger tablets; i.e., 
large screen distant audiences; it is responsive 
but smaller screens is not its primary audience. 
Its made to be navigated primarily through mouse/touch.

The quiz will seed questions in any category _provided you give the server your OPENAPI_AI_KEY_. 
Questions for the category Music at difficulty 5 will be seeded from JSON if you do not. 

## Deployment

the server reads from the dist folder that is generated by calling `yarn build`.
It must be generated for the app to be visible.
